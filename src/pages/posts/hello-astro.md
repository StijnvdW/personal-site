In my first blog post I'd like to elaborate on my choice for Astro as the web framework to build my personal blog.
<br>
<br> 
## Experiment

In my current job I'm using Angular a robust framework but it has it's limits. Even though recent releases have introduced great improvements it still wasn't my first choice. I was looking for a lightweight framework with focus on publishing content. The perfect fit for me seemed Astro which had been on my radar for over a year.  I was looking for an excuse to try it out! Working with Angular is great but I was longing for a new challenge and introduction into the [Island Architecture](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/).
<br>
<br>
## Simplicity
Astro is a well documented and easy web framewerk. This is what I experienced after completing a basic tutorial. One design principle of Astro is ['content-driven'](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#content-driven), creating a blog post is as easy as adding a Markdown file, no need to start with a headless CMS. A headless CMS can be added later on which offers me to add features later on.

## Easy integration of other frameworks
As one of my ambitions is to experiment with other frameworks like Angular, React, ... I'd like to show case those on my blog. This is [possible](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/framework-components/) with Astro and seems easy enough.
